Wisconsin Herbarium on Perl README

The source code Perl .cgi files have inline 
documentation of various quality.  Beware of 
out-of-date documentation!  Better to talk 
with Herbarium personnel when making changes. 
This code works nearly properly with respect 
to accepted species names and synonyms.  Be 
aware that this application is also coded in 
a Java "port" and a python "port".  The Java 
is a servlet (tomcat) application.  The python 
is a Google App Engine application.  The java 
and python versions are experimental.  This 
perl has been running as production for 
several years.
